## Pair programming

We offer pair programming sessions with community members to familiarize them with the product and the code base. This will give you an opportunity to clarify any doubts regarding the codebase and the features that interest you.

Once you have a local instance of Kosh running, you can make the changes you want to the code. Test the features and add appropriate documentation for it if needed.
